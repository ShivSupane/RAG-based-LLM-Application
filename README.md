# 🤖 Shiv GenAI RAG — Chat With Your Documents

A powerful **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application that allows users to upload documents and interact with them using **LLMs (Large Language Models)**.

Built using **Streamlit + FAISS + HuggingFace Embeddings + Groq API**, this app delivers fast, intelligent, and context-aware responses.

## 🚀 Features

* 📂 Upload your own `.txt` documents
* 🔍 Intelligent document search using **FAISS vector database**
* 🧠 Context-aware answers using **RAG pipeline**
* ⚡ Ultra-fast responses powered by **Groq LLMs**
* 💬 Chat-style interface (like ChatGPT)
* 🌐 Ready for deployment (Streamlit Cloud / Hugging Face)
